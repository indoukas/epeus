<p> This web resource by <b>Ioannis Doukas</b> is part of a research project focusing on three late Greek epic poems (ca. 2ndâ€“6th century AD): the <cite>Posthomerica</cite> by <b>Quintus of Smyrna</b>, <cite>The Sack of Troy</cite> by <b>Triphiodorus</b> and <cite>The Abduction of Helen</cite> by <b>Colluthus</b>.</p>

<p>These texts are re-workings of the narrative episodes from the Trojan War story, which are best known as the subject-matter of the lost poems of the Epic Cycle, relating the events which either precede or follow the <cite>Iliad</cite>. Within the context of their recent scholarly re-evaluation, the project starts from the premise that they can only be adequately interpreted in terms of their relationship with earlier literature (hence Waterhouse's Echo in the above illustration).</p>

<p>This digital resource is built as a test-case in the form of a digital commentary. Its purpose is to accompany the scholarly study of the epic poems included in this project in regard to either a) their parallels and sources or b) other data, such as named entities, found in them. Based on that, the resource focuses on making this relationship visible, by digitally facilitating the exploration of intertextuality as a dynamic phenomenon. To achieve this, the interface conceived allows for a) the interconnection of these texts with others, in already existing repositories, and b) visualisation of data contained in them.</p>

<p>In particular, the following narrative episodes are examined:</p>

<h2>1) Journey of Paris: <a href="paris_intro.html">IntroductionðŸ š</a> | <a href="paris_explorer.html">ExplorerðŸ š</a></h2>
<p>This test-case focuses on the passage describing the journey of Paris (Coluth. 201-229), and particularly on the placenames mentioned.</p>

<h2>2) Descriptions of the Trojan Horse: <a href="horse_intro.html">IntroductionðŸ š</a> | <a href="horse_explorer.html">ExplorerðŸ š</a></h2>
<p>This test-case focuses on the passages concerned with the building of the Trojan Horse in Triphiodorus (57-105) and Quintus (XII 104-156).</p>

<p>These are also analysed in corresponding chapters of the doctoral dissertation; the resource functions as a digital representation both of the gradual build-up of the philological argument and of the conclusions drawn. The prepared resource should be understood as an example of the application of the designed concept, fitted to the scope and size of a personal doctoral project, but also serving as an model for future adaptation and expansion, so that it can be re-applied to other texts.</p>
