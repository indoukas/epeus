<h3>About the digital resource</h3>

<p>In this case, the main focus is on the comparison between the two texts, as they are share a common subject-matter, but treat it in a different way. The objective is to allow the user to read through the texts themselves, draw conclusions on what unites and separates the two versions and also zoom in to the small-scale verbal details, which function as carriers of significance and pointers to intertextual connections.</p>
<p>Upon entering the text explorer, the users is able to examine the convergences and dissimilarities of the texts on the verbal level through side-by-side comparison. The left column features the text of Quintus, the right contains the one by Triphiodorus. The user of the interface is able to read the passages, in the original Greek text and its English translation,<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> and scroll up and down in both works.</p>
<p>All passages, single words or phrases, that invite intertextual reading, are underlined and clickable. A click on any given item in either of the texts highlights it, along with the respective word or phrase in the other text, when applicable, and the corresponding comment loads in a frame at the footer of the page. The footer comments contain the discursive analysis of the passages, drawn from the dissertation; when an intertextual reference to another text is present, the citation links to the passage in question.</p>
